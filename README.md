# NLP_SentimentAnalysis

For this project, I developed a sentiment analysis model using various supervised machine learning algorithms to classify customer reviews. 

The dataset consists of movie theater reviews, with each entry containing two columns: the first column includes the text of the review (unstructured data), while the second column contains a binary rating (1 or 0), likely indicating whether the review is positive or negative. Below is an outline of the approach I followed to build and evaluate the model.
