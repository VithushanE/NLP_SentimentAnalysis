# NLP_SentimentAnalysis

For this project, I developed a sentiment analysis model using various supervised machine learning algorithms to classify customer reviews. 

The dataset consists of movie theater reviews, with each entry containing two columns: the first column includes the text of the review (unstructured data), while the second column contains a binary rating (1 or 0), likely indicating whether the review is positive or negative. Below is an outline of the approach I followed to build and evaluate the model.

## Step 1: Data Exploration


## Step 2: Modelling with different ML algorithms 

## Step 3: Assessing ML algorithms

## Step 4: Logistic regression with different Hyperparameter Tuning Combinations 

## Step 5: Examining results from a business point of view

## Step 6: Visualizing Correct predictions with Label 0 and 1
