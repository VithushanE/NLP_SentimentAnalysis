# NLP_SentimentAnalysis

For this project, I trained a NLP machine learning model for sentiment analysis using various supervised machine learning algorithms. 

The dataset appears to have reviews from customers who recently went to a movie theatre. The first column includes the actual revview which is unstructured data, and the second column is given a rating of either 1 or 0, presumably being a good or bad review.
